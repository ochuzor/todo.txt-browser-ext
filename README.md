This is a browser extension implementation for [todo.txt](https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt). Works fine both with Chrome and Firefox browsers. The extension was built using [Reactjs](https://reactjs.org/).

There have been a lot of implementations for the [todo.txt](https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt) online. The main idea for this implementation is is for learning.

It utilizes some of my todo.txt libraries such as:

[todo.txt-parser](https://github.com/ochuzor/todo.txt-parser):  a todo.txt text parser library.
It provides a way to parse a todo.txt text and extract all the data in it.

[todo.txt-indexer](https://github.com/ochuzor/todo.txt-indexer): an indexer library for todo.txt data items.
The indexers also provide a way to search through the list of todos.

[todo.txt-store](https://github.com/ochuzor/todo.txt-store): a store library for working with todo.txt data items. It provides a set of classes and utility functions for storing and retrieving todo.txt data items. You can store in local storage, text files and even a browser's url.

While working on this project, I found this tutorial very useful [How to use React.js to create...](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/how-to-use-react-js-to-create-chrome-extension-in-5-minutes-2ddb11899815).
